#### Razer mouse control utility
> üåàÔ∏è Configure Razer Chroma devices from the command line

## What's this?
`rzctl(1)` is a command line utility that allows changing the colorization parameters of Razer Chroma devices.

## Supported devices
For the time being it only supports the one (and probably last) Razer device I own, the (seemingly discontinued) Razer Deathadder Chroma I found laying around and repaired for fun.
Feel free to add your own via PR!

- `1532:0043` Razer Deathadder Chroma

## Quick start
```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/my-nick-is-taken/rzctl
# Build rzctl
cd rzctl && make
# Try it out!
rzctl list-devices
# Try rzctl --help for all supported commands
```

## Open-source code
This software depends on [argtable/argtable3](https://github.com/argtable/argtable3/) because I wanted to try out something new for parsing command line arguments. I'm very happy with the outcome.
